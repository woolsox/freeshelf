# README

During this project, you will build a Ruby on Rails application to collect an index of free programming books online. This application will, after three days, allow users to look at the index, add new books, edit books they added, and remove books.

On the first day, your application should:

Allow anyone to create a new book entry
Books have, at a minimum, a title, author, description, and URL
Allow anyone to update or delete a book entry
Allow anyone to view the list of books
On the second day, your application should:

Allow users to register and login
Prevent users from creating, editing, or deleting book entries if they are not logged in
On the third day, your application should:

Associate each book entry with a user
Prevent editing a book unless you are the book entry's creator
Prevent deleting a book unless you are the book entry's creator
